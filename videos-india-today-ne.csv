Around 20-25 villages in Chirang, including Nangalbhanga, are in the grip of floods. The flood has been caused by the rise in the water levels of the Aai, Nangalbhanga, and Makra rivers due to the water coming down from neighbouring Bhutan. Many villages on the Indo-Bhutan border have already been flooded by the rising waters of the rivers that have been rising since night. Fearing that the water of the Nangalbhanga River currently flowing above the danger level may cause severe flooding in the area at any moment. A severe situation prevails among the people of around 12-13 villages.

This behavior caused frustration among the passengers who came to book tickets for the Gorakhpur-bound passenger train. Witnesses claim that numerous passengers were waiting in a queue at the Harinagar ticket booking counter, but Roshan Singh, who was on duty, failed to issue tickets due to his inebriation.

NeJr5ruQEqA,"Assam: Wild Elephants Create Havoc, Schools Shut Down In Kampur","A chaotic situation unfolded at Kampur in Assam's Nagaon district, as a herd of elephants caused havoc, prompting the authorities to take immediate action. Three local schools were closed as a result of the crisis until the situation could be brought under control..
 Furthermore, business establishments were shut down to prevent any further unfortunate incidents.

The local municipality used the microphone to convey urgent warnings to the locals, asking them to remain vigilant.

 These safety measures were necessary after a herd of wild elephants attacked two people, seriously injuring them, after straying from their natural habitat. 

The injured people were immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but due to their critical condition, they had to be transferred to Nagaon Hospital for advanced medical care.

 Apart from injuring humans, the marauding elephants also caused extensive damage to residential properties, leaving the residents in a state of panic. Several houses were demolished, compounding the fears of the affected community. In addition to the destruction of property, the rampage resulted in the loss of livestock, further exacerbating the plight of the villagers.

In an exclusive interview with India Today NE, Trinamool Congress General Secretary, who has been spearheading the party’s campaign for Meghalaya assembly poll, sought to dispel the notion that the party’s Meghalaya unit is a re-packaged unit of defecting Congress leaders. The new age politician also exuded confidence that unlike the allegations levelled by its rivals, the TMC is not being perceived by voters in the hill state as a Bengali party. He also said that in the larger interest of defeating the BJP, the Congress must keep aside its ego and come forward for strategic alliances.

 Most pollsters predict that in the Tripura assembly poll scheduled on February 16 Tipra Motha, headed by Pradyot Manikya Debbarma, scion of the erstwhile royal family of Tripura, will corner majority of the 20 seats reserved for STs in the 60-member legislature. With such an expected outcome, Debbarma, who has emerged as the strongest and most credible voice advocating the rights of the indigenous people, is most likely to become a kingmaker, if not the king. India Today magazine’s Executive Editor Kaushik Deka joined him on a campaign trail to find out what is making the Bubagra (king) so popular among the tribals. Unlike the common perception, he doesn’t spit venom against the majority Bangla population. Instead, he reiterates fighting for the rights of his own people doesn’t mean he is against any community, including the Bengali population, Tripura’s majority group.

Arunachal Pradesh observed the seventh edition of Pakke Paga festival, a unique festival to conserve the state bird, Hornbill, on January 22. The festival was observed in an enthusiastic manner at Seijosa of Pakke Kesang district of Arunachal.
The Pakke Paga Hornbill festival, is a unique celebration that promotes conservation of wildlife and nature, focussing specifically towards the conservation of the state bird Hornbill.
Forest and Environment minister Mama Natung attended the festival at Seijosa town of Pakke Kesang district of Arunachal bordering Assam and home of Pakke tiger reserve wildlife Sanctuary. 
The minister appreciated the objective of the festival and lauded the efforts of the people for taking this unique initiative promoting conservation and protection of nature.
The minister called upon the people to conserve and protect flora and fauna of the state. He also advised the people to properly utilise the boon of nature and pass it on to the next generation in better condition. 

The minister appreciated the elders and community leaders of the Nyishi community for their initiative to do away with use of Hornbill beaks for their headgear and instead using fibre glass beaks.

b1vj1Nrc8ZM,"No separate Kamtapur state, no compromise with the interest of the Assamese people","#kamtapur #ugbrahma #assam
Speaking on the lines of the ongoing demand for a separate Kamtapur state by the pro-scribed armed rebel group Kamtapur Liberation Organisation, Assam Minister UG Brahma stated that no separate Kamtapur state will be created and that whatever decision the government of India takes, is good for the people of the nation. “The interest of the people of Assam will always remain intact”, said minister UG Brahma.
Although the Chief Minister of the state has expressed his non-interest about the demand for a separate Kamtapur state, Assam minister UG Brahma reiterated that the government of Assam will never allow the formation of a separate Kamtapur state.
“KLO have demanded for a separate Kamtapur state. There can be many demands.Ddemands for Bodoland were also raised where the entire northern Assam was sought but the BTR formed by the Government of India is limited to only 4/5 districts. The agreement which will be made should not be harmful to anyone. It will give an opportunity to the Koch Rajbanshi areas of West Bengal to develop by bringing them to autonomous areas instead of separate states and the Government of India will make arrangements for the protection of language and culture by further strengthening the Kamtapur Autonomous Council of Assam”, added the minister.
Speaking about the development and popularity of Assam’s cultural markers, minister UG Brahma said, “The Assamese gamosa has already got the ""GI tag"", after which the ""Aranai"" of the Bodo community of Assam will also get the ""GI-tag"" by very soon. On the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure that GI tag can be applied to all the indigenous textiles of Assam”, added minister UG Brahma.

UG Brahma further stated, “In the first month of 2023, the government has been bringing good news to the weavers of Assam. The Government of Assam will also buy the textiles of the ethnic communities including gamosa, pajar, arnai woven or manufactured by the weavers of Assam. As a result, the weavers will not have to suffer from harassment. He said that the problem of yarn being supplied at subsidised rates by the Assam government through artfed will also be solved”.

obgL8QuYFuo,'Who is Shah Rukh Khan'? Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma opens up over 'Pathan' controversy,"#himantabiswasarma #pathaan #srk
Assam chief minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma reacted to the ongoing controversy surrounding the Shah Rukh Khan starrer ""Pathan"".

Notably along with the rest of India, in Assam also #boycottpathan has gripped the right-wing Hindu activists.

In a press meeting while replying to a question on the recent vandalism of Bajrang Dal activists in Narangi in Guwahati Assam CM said, ""Who is Shah Rukh Khan...I don't know anything about 'Pathan'.""

""If someone has done anything wrong let the victims file a case and we shall take action...Shah Rukh Khan did not call me if anything was to worry about,"" he added.

However, till now nor the cinema hall owner nor the production house of the movie has raised any complaint.

Further, the CM said that why should one think about Shah Rukh Khan and claimed that there are many things to worry about in the state.

""We should think about the Assamese movie 'Dr. Bezbaruah' and that we all should watch the movie,"" he added.

The CM also claimed that he will not go to watch the Shah Rukh Khan starrer ""Pathan"" and told a reporter, ""If you want to go please go and watch..you will get full security.""

Himanta Biswa Sarma also said that in 8-10 days' time, people from Bollywood usually call him up related to any projects or works and if Shah Rukh Khan calls him he will definitely look into the matter.

It is to be mentioned here that, members of the Bajrang Dal stormed into Narengi’s LG Towers on January 20  and forcibly pulled down posters promoting the upcoming movie ""Pathaan"". The Bajrang Dal warned that it will not allow the movie - which is scheduled to be released later this month to be released anywhere in the state.

Shouting slogans against the movie, dozens of Bajrang Dal workers barged into the campus which has a multiplex and tore down posters and cut-outs promoting the movie, which features Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone.

Posters were set on fire, and furniture was broken.""Jai Shri Ram"" slogans were also raised during the vandalism. The right-wing group justified their violent protest by calling it an action in ""honour of dharma"".

However, there is a section in a society where people do appreciate girl child and considers it to be ""Lakshmi"" in disguise.

On January 18, the least can say about is when a man jumped from the top of a goverment hospital building to take his own life after becoming a proud father of a boy.

The incident has been reported from Assam's Jorhat district wherein a man hailing from Rajabari in Bokakhat jump off the hospital building.

As per reports, the man identified as Jitumoni Das took the drastic step after his wife delivered a boy and not a girl as her husband wished for.

Meanwhile, people present in the hospital premises rescued the injured individual and got him admitted to the Jorhat Medical College and Hospital, the same hospital where his wife has been admitted to deliver his son.

Family members claim that Jitumoni was not behaving normally before after the birth of his son and looked very tense before jumping off from the building.

To commemorate the 160th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on the occasion of National Youth Day Department of Youth affairs Arunachal Pradesh organized an event at Dorjee Khandu Convention hall at Itanagar. 
Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs of Arunachal Pradesh, Mama Natung graced the event with great enthusiasm.
The Youth Affairs Minister asserted that youths of Arunachal Pradesh have tremendous potential to meaningfully contribute in nation building as envisioned by the great monk of the country, Swami Vivekananda, whose 160th birth anniversary is being celebrated as the National Youth Day across the country today.
Mama Natung said youths of today have access to education like never before and therefore are better equipped to shape the future of the state and the country.
He said Arunachal Pradesh is unique owing to its culturally diverse communities – about 26 major tribes and more than 100 sub-tribes – and that the onus is upon the educated and conscious youths of today to foster the pan-Arunachal identity by maintaining peace and communal harmony.
He lauded the Vivekananda Kendra for venturing into Arunachal and providing quality education specially in the late 70s through Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalayas, whose students are today in service of the nation in various capacities.
Natung also emphasized on the role of today’s youths, who he pointed can be game changers if they have the will and guts.
“Youths today must have ‘muscles of iron and nerves of steel’, as quoted by Swamiji. They must have the guts to stand up against what is wrong. When they start to raise their voices against all things wrong, not only the outlook of the society will change but also keep the government on its toes,”

All the wrongdoings related to APPSCE fiasco will be addressed, no one will be spared informed Home Minister, Bamang Felix.

Speaking to the media, Home Minister Bamang Felix said, there is no outcome, everyone's goal is the same and that it is a preliminary meeting.

B1AyeMyszFE,"Arunachal government holds first cabinet meeting of 2023, key takeaways","#arunachalpradesh #pemakhandu #statecivilsecretariat

The first Cabinet Meeting of 2023 was held on January 10  2023 under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Pema Khandu at the state civil secretariat, Itanagar. 

Below are the key discussions/observations/decisions.

1. Harnessing the Hydropower potential of Arunachal Pradesh in a sustainable manner for the benefit of the local communities, state and the nation. 

2. Arunachal, through its hydropower, would contribute majorly towards India’s Commitment to increasing non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW. 

3. Hydropower is a major source of renewable energy and if harnessed would bring in the all-round socio-economic development of the area through massive investment in infrastructure as well as provisions such as free power, local area development fund, employment, contracts and business opportunities, social sector development such as health and education. 

4. Today the Cabinet deliberated and finalised an action plan for unlocking this rich potential. The Cabinet decided that some important stalled projects currently with IPPs will now be handed over to CPSUs for development. 

5. Cabinet decided to handover over 5 already terminated projects to the CPSUs namely, (i) Naying(1000MW) and (ii) Hirong (500MW) to NEEPCO and (iii) Emini(500MW), (iv) Amulin(420MW), (v) Minundon(400MW) to SJVNL for development.  

6. These projects will see an investment of Rs.40000 Cr in the next 5-7 years and would generate green power of 2880 MW and provide revenue of around Rs.500 Cr per year in free power and around Rs.100 Cr for Local Area Development. 

7. The Cabinet approved the indicative procedure for transferring the stalled hydropower projects from the IPP to CPSUs in order to unlock the potential. An Action Plan has been prepared to commence the work on 13 priority projects with 12343 MW capacity. This would lead to an investment of Rs.1.5 lakh Crore and would provide a revenue of Rs.2000 Cr to the state as a free power and around Rs.350 Cr per year for local area development. 

8. The Cabinet also approved the inclusion of one male and one female member in the Local Area Development Committee set up under the Deputy Commissioner for the management of the Local Area Development Fund. 

9. The Cabinet also approved that revenue generated by the State Government through the free power will be invested in Government Bonds/Green Bonds which would be used for the development of the State.

As this film directed by renowned filmmaker and lyricist Laimayum Banka Sharma was scheduled to be screened only for one day in two slots, many didn’t get tickets. Those who came out after watching movie highly appreciated whosoever concerned involved in archiving the movie in digital format. 

“Getting an opportunity to watch this old movie is an immense pleasure for me. I have been longing to watch this movie as I heard of it very often even though it was produced before was born. My parents always narrated the story of this movie earlier,” Nina, 28 years old from Imphal East told to India Today NE. She also expressed her wishes of converting more Manipuri celluloid film into digital format.

Playback singer of the film, Chongtham Kamala Devi who is in her 80s said to India Today NE that reviving of the famed celluloid Manipuri movie Yairipok Thambalnu by converting into digital format is big opportunity of the state. This will provide an opportunity to young generation in letting them know about Manipuri society in those days. On top of that, it can also help to preserve this film produced way back in 1980s with many difficulties due to absence of well-equipped technology.

She said that the movie has showcased many traditional, cultural and religious practices which are no longer exist. Another important message that was conveyed is courage and sacrificing spirit of a lady portrait in the film as heroine.

""I hope with this movie young generation will surely get the chance to see some of the dying culture and tradition of state. Youth should learn those important messages given in the film,"" she stated.

It may be mentioned that “Yairipok Thambalnu” is a Manipuri cinema based on real story of a lady called Thambalnu from Yairipok under Andro district. The story shows the courage and ability of “Thambalnu” to sacrifice her life for society leaving her loved ones. 

The main role of the movie was played by Birbabu, Hemabati, Nilbir, Ravindra and Keshoram.

visOkyJReKw,Satra land in Majuli allegedly faces encroachment under administration’s nose,"#majuli #satra #encroachments 
Alleged encroachment on satra land in Majuli has been raising concern at a time when the state government is having zero tolerance on encroachment in various parts of the state.
The alleged encroachment took place on agricultural land of Adhar Mahora Satra located at Senaribari village.
Sources said that Satradhikar of the satra Mahesh Chandra Dev Goswami for the last 40 years have been indulging in agriculture on the land and with the revenue running the satra.
Locals rued the fact that the administration has been allegedly ignoring the directive of the chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma regarding conservation of satra land.
Sources further said that as many as 35 bighas of land of Adhar Mahora satra have been encroached and suspected individuals have started making houses on the said land. 
It has been further alleged that many bighas of land of the satra has been sold off without knowledge of the satradhikar.
Earlier, authorities in Assam had launched eviction drive on 400 acres of government land at the Baghbor Satra in the Barpeta district on the morning of December 26.
As such, several families have already vacated the land, but there were still 30 families who were staying there illegally even after receiving the eviction notice. 

The drive is carried out by district administration and security personnel on 400 bighas of encroached land where almost 45 families were illegally staying.
 In an another incident a massive eviction drive was carried out on 1200 bighas (nearly 397 acres) of land by Nagaon district administration on December 19.

It is learnt that the eviction drive was carried out by Nagaon district administration in different areas of Batadrava.
The eviction drive was carried out in large areas like Hai Dubi, Jamai Basti, Shanti Jan Bazar etc.
Speaking in the assembly during a Zero Hour discussion initiated by Congress MLA Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said the BJP government will continue to carry out eviction exercises and ""there is no point talking about it"".

The positions of police constables have remained vacant for the past five years. 

A new debate on how to increase employment in the nation has been ignited by the massive turnout at the Islamabad Police Recruitment. Pakistan's unemployment rate has peaked. 

The number of unemployed people is also steadily rising because there is so little hiring for government positions. Despite this, thousands of applicants are competing for the open positions in the public sector.

6VFy7fq2Gv0,Mehalgaya's remarkable living root bridges attract tourists across the globe,"#meghalaya #eastkhasihillsdistrict #livingrootbridges

In the East khasi hills district the village Mawlynnlong has something unique which is a beautiful example of the bonding shared by humans and nature and that is Living Root bridges.
There are many such bridges in the west Jaintia & East Khali hills district of Meghalaya which has been made by the Khasi and Jaintia community members.The living root bridge is the best example of organic engineering.
During monsoon it rains heavily in this village,hence many years ago the people residing here planted banyan trees along the banks of rivers and when these trees grow they start developing aerial roots with the help of which root bridges are constructed.
The natural elasticity of banyan trees keep these bridges intact.These roots are covered by the shell of bamboos or betel but to give shape to these bridges.Thereon stones and mud are used to make the walking Pata over the bridge.
This process of making a living root bridge takes 10 to 15 years and on completion these bridges can survive for upto 500 years. There is no maintenance cost evolved to make these natural bridges and these living root bridges are a fine example of humans dependence on nature and vice versa.
The length of these more than 100 years old bridges is almost 65 feet and is 6 to 8 feet wide and it's so strong that about 500 people can cross it at once.
Being one of the heavy rain areas this region of Meghalaya which is devoid of any properly engineered or government constructed bridges,people has a unique importance of such root bridges.The villagers living down use them in their day to day life and it's a boon for them as they are being helped by mother nature itself.
Steel bridges begin rusting and get weaker when it rains whereas living root bridges turn stronger in such cases.For it's natural uniqueness these bridges are a major tourist attraction who visit Cherrapunjee locally known as Sohra.
Tourists from Mumbai, kolkata, Delhi and many other states including foreign tourists visit in huge numbers to see this natural wonder bridges made up by roots of trees.Despite the heavy trekking down 3500 steps and climbing up many tourists say that it's worth to see these bridges.
Tourists who have few health complications also trek down slowly and comes getting exhausted and many youngsters also get tired heavily witnessing this steep down trekking down to see living root bridge of Cherrapunjee locally known as Sohra.

I didn’t take the stretcher but led my wife on foot to the room as every after 2 months we go for check up and everything was fine till date. But don’t know why my wife delivered a lifeless child,” a victim’s husband said.
Attendants of the victims also claimed that nurses in the hospital demanded money to the tune of Rs 25000 from them.
Meanwhile, Das admitted to have inadequate doctors in JSB hospital.
“It also depends upon the expertise of the nurses. If the nurses think that the delivery is in their capacity they conduct the delivery without the help of senior doctor,” Das said.
Das further said that mothers deliver lifeless children due to lack of proper checkup during their pregnancy period. He said that the time of reference from PHC’s and sub-centres to central hospitals is much crucial. IUDF’s also take place when at proper time the mother is not referred to central hospital. Some people tend to deliver babies at home and the process of delivery gets delayed in the process,” he said.

Residents at Beshiya village in Dudhnoi, Rangjuli are furious over the non-fulfillment of free and safe drinking water to every household under the ambitious ‘Jal Jeevan’ scheme.

With hollow promises and no sign of any water supply, residents of Beshiya village are facing an acute drinking water crisis for a long time.

It is to be noted that in nearby Ambari village, there is a water supply scheme under the Jal Jeevan Mission, about one-and-a-half kilometres away, but the water does not reach Beshiya village. 

It is noteworthy, people walk to the nearest Hand pump to acquire their daily drinking water needs. Both men and women of the village draw water from a pitcher or bucket from the Hand pump. 

On the other hand, people complain that the contractor is doing very poor quality work. The water pipe is broken due to which the water of the Jal Jeevan Mission does not reach Beshiya village.

There is a scheme, but no sign of water. The slogan of Jal Jeevan is limited only to ‘Ghar Ghar Nal Se Jal’, but in reality, the residents are forced to walk long distances in search of pure, drinking water.
  
On the other hand, every year during the drought, the villagers have to go far and collect water due to the drying up of the 
 
Therefore, people have appealed to the divisional authorities to build a water supply scheme in the village and provide drinking water in the well.

The Adi or ‘Bangni-Boker lhoba’ people are the major collective tribes living in the Himalayan hills of the ‘Nyingchi’ prefecture. Since they belonged to all agricultural communities, the ‘Solung’ festival is primarily connected with the agricultural activities of the people.

The ‘Solung’ of the Adi community can be compared with the three Bihus of the Assamese people, as they are also socio-religious, which has a close connection with agriculture. Prevalent among the Adi community are various myths, stories, faiths, and beliefs about the origin of the ‘Solung’ festival.

The incident reported from Assam's Kaljar village of Howly, under the Barpeta district, has been laughed off by a section of the society, but on the other hand, it also reflects the perpetual hunger and poverty that exists in the society, which does not make the poor people ashamed of their actions even if they beg for food on behalf of their children.

Whatsoever, the incident has invited mixed reactions, as after a verbal argument that broke out over a boiled egg, it later took the shape of a big fisticuff.

MW2SsLKhvPk,AICC Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh on Himanta Biswa Sarma’s exit from Congress,"Good riddance of rubbish: AICC Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh on Himanta Biswa Sarma’s exit from Congress


Ever since Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, a former Congressman, left the grand old party in 2015, he has inflicted multiple damages to his former party. He not only joined the BJP but also emerged as the chief architect of the saffron party’s expansion in the northeast. In Manipur in 2017, and in Meghalaya in 2018, the Congress, despite becoming the single largest party, failed to form the government because of Sarma’s backroom manoeuvring. After 2021, when he became the CM of Assam, two sitting Congress MLAs joined the BJP, and several others are reportedly on the verge of switching sides. In the recently held presidential election, nearly a dozen Congress MLAs, out of a total of 27, reportedly voted for the NDA candidate. Amid speculation that the Congress would conduct a lie detector test to find out who had cross-voted for the NDA candidate, AICC in charge of Assam and former Union Minister Jitendra Singh spoke exclusively to India Today NE Deputy Editor Afrida Hussain on why the Congress had failed in keeping its house in order in Assam.

cR_I13kXIXg,Sick man from Manipur ferried across a flooded Barak river,"The video of the sick man being taken on the bamboo raft, navigating a seemingly flooded and muddy Barak river to the nearest health centre has gone viral now. The father of four children, Jukenkhaibou whose health deteriorated after falling sick few days ago, would have never imagined that the journey to the hospital would be so treacherous.

Hailing from Tamenglong District Manipur, the villagers tried their best to treat Jukenkhaibou, but his health did not improve. With no option left, and the nearest public health centre situated right across a shabby, broken road that has been left damaged due to the recent floods and landslides, the villagers decide to take the sick patient across the flooded Barak river to the Peren district hospital in Nagaland instead of Tamei Hospital in Manipur.
