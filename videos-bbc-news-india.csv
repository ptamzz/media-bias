7gwpJHRuxOM,How the world's oldest university was lost for 800 years | BBC News India,"Founded more than 1,500 years ago, India's ancient Nalanda University is thought to have been the world's first residential university.

Established more than 500 years before Oxford University, at its peak Nalanda hosted over 10,000 students from around the globe. It is considered by historians to be one of the great centres of learning of the ancient world.

The university was destroyed towards the end of the 12th Century AD. Its legendary library burned to the ground and much of its ancient knowledge was lost.

Now, 800 years later, the university is being revived for the modern age.

iQQeTfvdRFM,'The cost of not having LGBTQ+ allies can be death' | The definition of allyship | BBC News India,"As the Supreme Court gears up to hear the final arguments on pleas seeking to legalise same-sex marriage in India, the BBC explores questions around the meaning of LGBTQ+ allyship in India.

In 2022, a 16-year-old Indian student killed themselves after being subjected to mockery, derision, and abuse from peers at their school for being 'effeminate'. Many people from the LGBTQ+ community across the globe live under similar fear and loneliness. Would the situation be different if they had allies? But who are these allies? What are they supposed to do and what does allyship truly mean?

ZPL8QhKIrho,The woman fighting to save Mumbai's Aarey forest | BBC News India,"In the Indian megacity of Mumbai, there’s an urban forest four times the size of New York’s Central Park. It’s home to a community of indigenous people who live alongside leopards. The land is prime real estate and over recent decades chunks have been converted.  
Now the government is going ahead with a controversial plan to cut further into the forest to build a depot for subway trains. The project has sparked widespread protests and a debate about conservation and development. We follow one indigenous family as they struggle to hold on to their unique way of life.
This film was first broadcast on the BBC in November 2022.
